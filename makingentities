For enemies, I guess use the Enemy class.
We should also have something for more dynamic enemies that have limbs and whatnot.



** Note on drawing humanoid entities.

	Some new modelling/building functions can be found in 'townfolkbuildingfunctions.js'.

	There was kind of an issue with the left side of the head, so I redid it.
	Find the diagram in my notebook.

	Eventually, you should completely redo this, there seems to be more issues.
	(Of course you can just use the left x-face as a template and multiply the vertices
	to the correct position before pushing. )

	Most of the other vertices look okay, but for the weird top of head lighting,
	you can always add more triangles to the top of the head.





**Traversing for entities with multiple appendages. 

	In order to draw an entity that has multiple limbs, you need to ensure
	the class has a few attributes.
		1) 	It needs an array to hold mv matrices: modelViewStack = [];
		2)	It needs some function to create/update nodes for each appendage.
			say 'update_node(id, x,y,z)'.
			This should be called whenever there is an update to a particular
			appendage (e.g., movement or an animation.)
		3) 	It needs an array to hold information about / nodes for 
			each portion of the model: model = [];
		4)	It needs a function to traverse and draw all the appendages
			of the model: traverse(id). (This will be the function
			called when you wish to draw the entity.)


	** Nodes

		Within 'player.js' there is a function:

		function create_node(transform, render, sibling, child){
			var node = {
				transform: transform,
				render: render,
				sibling: sibling,
				child: child,
			};
			return node;
		}




	Question: What does traverse do? What does 'id' represent?

	Answer: traverse is a recursive function that.
