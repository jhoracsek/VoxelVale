		when zoomed out.									()


Fix loading times.

	Move wooden bucket down slightly in inventory.				()

	When you hold and cursor is green it expands. 				()


Update Alpha 0.5.0 (Water you waiting for).

	Do the toolbar update.

	Do water/buckets.

	Maybe bridges.

Can add a little iron brim around the bucket.




Update Alpha 0.6.0 (Pass me a brew.)

	Add brewing stand.
		Use buckets to fill with water.
		Water should diminish as you make potions.
			(Not like the forge will!)
			(Just like each time you craft something water goes down)
			Forge will be like a timer. With particles shooting out when it's active.

	Zombie drops.

	Plants and what not.

	Glass bottles too!

		(Village randomly generates a path and the building is generated on a new portion.)


Fix Cover (art?).

	Alpha 0.6.0 | Quality of Life.

Update for Armour | That's Armoure


Update 0.5.0 | Water you waiting for?

	5. Maybe add a starting menu?
		Would be good for itch.

	(only some pools have sand maybe.)
	8. Sand?
	9. Cactus

Inventory lighting issue (for transparent)
	Maybe comes from squishing objects too much.
	Try to adjust this.

Should fix quantity display over all inventories.

I really like the metal alloy idea.

Shop questions:
	Should objects reset?
	Maybe include a timer if they do?
	Maybe not all objects reset? Like some are persistent?
	(Also how does this affect save/load?)

Make potion system like zelda.
	3. Fix the thing where upone makes the ceiling opaque if you're not on a block.
		(Move to next update.)	

athanor (alchemy)

Bow no! (Update for bows.)


Notes:
	generateGlobalStructures handles global structures in the world.

	WORLD_SIZE = 25.

	Border exists from: 
		Bottom left: 	(0,0)
		Top right:		(259,259)

	So in general global structures must start in the range:
		(0,0) to (WORLD_SIZE*PORTION_SIZE+PORTION_SIZE-1, WORLD_SIZE*PORTION_SIZE+PORTION_SIZE-1)
		or
		(0,0) to (WORLD_SIZE*10+9, WORLD_SIZE*10+9)

		But push in by 1 on each side because the border. So:
		(1,1) to (WORLD_SIZE*10+8, WORLD_SIZE*10+8)

	Global structures are generated in 'make_world()' in 'worldgen.js'

Can make a mechanics video about world generation?
	- You can showcase it by turning off the grass.
	- I.e., prevent the grass from generating.
	- Can even get footage today.
	- Should do this when all structures are in place.

Make the game require signup to play.
	Explain this is to track user engagement.

Idea for toolbar
	Can keep hold/drop buttons as they were before,
	but move them so they are like where the move and moveall buttons
	are.

	When you select the item, you get [1,2,3,4] to manually select
	the toolbar position.

Maybe if it rains the level of water networks increase?

Bosses can be like BOTW, there are set locations when the map is generated.
If you enter their radius it begins the fight.
They could start off sleeping?

ADD MICHAEL SCOTT!

Also villagers/towns/villages. 

Mob ideas.

Make the sign in thing more friendly?
Also maybe make it so that mobile users can play? (Would be hard as fuck tbh.)

Could just like partition screen so game is played in the middle

(Should add that thing where when you place blocks it places one above... like maybe draw an arrow.)

Need to fix notification queue when mining ores! (Not super important/ low priority!)

Maybe make dungeons just like a fixed number of them. Like how the shop will be generated.

Make difficulty scale as you get further away from center.
	Should also mark center.

	Improve movement of bow cursor.
	Adjustable mouse sensisitivity.
	Cannot close window with cmd w.
	See objects returned when crafting.
	Ghosts as mobs that interact with light.
		They avoid lights, but can move through walls.
	Tweak player walking animations.
		Maybe revert to the old style.
		Maybe stop animations when action stops.
	Tweak inventory lighting.
	Local version, maybe on steam (can do local storage).

	Improving stone generation / ores.

	Potential update names.
		Moving on up! (If you ever decided to add verticle movement.)

		Online Update | Better Together!
		Lighting Update | Let there be (better?) light!
		Multiplayer | Better Together or It takes two... or three.

	Try 'drawContents' without the background.
	Include object properties like damage and stuff in the inventory.
	Similarly, give objects specific weight.

	Can add to pass me a brew update.
	Green potions with mysterious effects (dropped from zombies).
	Zombie heart/eye for brewing.
	Brewing stand.

	Maybe expand toolbar?

	Run ad campaign for the website itself.


Crap ideas:

I kind of have an idea for improving rendering. You could just store objectNumbers per portion. You do lose some instance info for grass blocks. But when you render you could just call a static draw function which you get by using the objectNumber on an array like when saving. Could also have a tandem array that defines instance variables. (Just an idea, don't worry about it now.)
