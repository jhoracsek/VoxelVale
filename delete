Outline two approaches for water.

	Finite (Going with this one)

	Networks only need to be updated on world changes.
	So you can add a flag for blocks being placed or removed.
	If any of the adjacent blocks are water then you can determine the network
	and run its update.

	(Trickier when placing water, might need to update for a few frames.)



	Water to do.
		Split network on block placed.								(X)
			Fix the level thing.									(X)
			Fix the other three cases.								(X)
		
		Actually kill the network when it's not alive.				(X)
		Fix network updating.										()
			Should probably only start updating on action.			()

		Move wooden bucket down slightly in inventory.				()

		Save/load :/												()

		Implement bucket picking up water.							()
		Figure out litres stuff.									()
		Figure out bucket/capacity.									()
		Finish the bucket drawing water.							()
		Implement the bucket fullness meter.						()
		Ensure network splits on bucket pickup.						()


Add campaign for website***

Idea for toolbar
	Can keep hold/drop buttons as they were before,
	but move them so they are like where the move and moveall buttons
	are.

	When you select the item, you get [1,2,3,4] to manually select
	the toolbar position.


Buckets should be craftable...

Maybe if it rains the level of water networks increase?

So if you place a block over water, you should remove it from the network.
This will automatically increase the level which is nice...
but this make also lead to disconnected networks.


Bosses can be like BOTW, there are set locations when the map is generated.
If you enter their radius it begins the fight.
They could start off sleeping?

ADD MICHAEL SCOTT!

Also villagers. 

A shopkeep that spawns somewhere randomly would be great!

Mob ideas.
Need to add chests.

Make the sign in thing more friendly?
Also maybe make it so that mobile users can play? (Would be hard as fuck tbh.)

Could just like partition screen so game is played in the middle

(Should add that thing where when you place blocks it places one above... like maybe draw an arrow.)

Crap ideas:

I kind of have an idea for improving rendering. You could just store objectNumbers per portion. You do lose some instance info for grass blocks. But when you render you could just call a static draw function which you get by using the objectNumber on an array like when saving. Could also have a tandem array that defines instance variables. (Just an idea, don't worry about it now.)
