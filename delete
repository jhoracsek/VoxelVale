Inventory lighting issue (for transparent)
	Maybe comes from squishing objects too much.
	Try to adjust this.

Water to do.
	Fix network updating.										()
		Should start updating on action.						()
		Implement 'startUpdate' function (see below).			()

	Optimize checkAdj.											()
		Use world.getFluid().									()
		Only need to check edges!								()

	Move wooden bucket down slightly in inventory.				()

	Save/load 													()

	When you hold and cursor is green it expands. 				()

Networks only need to be updated on world changes.
So you can add a flag for blocks being placed or removed.
If any of the adjacent blocks are water then you can determine the network
and run its update.

For the WaterNetworks 'startUpdate' function this is how I think it should work.
	- When a block at z = -2 is interacted with, check it and all it's adjacent blocks.
	- If any are a fluid, then run block.network.startUpdate().
	- On startUpdate(), the networks counter gets set to say like 30?
	- It will then only update for 30 frames.

Should lay groundwork for water generation.			()



Bow no! (Update for bows.)



Notes:
	generateGlobalStructures handles global structures in the world.

	WORLD_SIZE = 25.

	Border exists from: 
		Bottom left: 	(0,0)
		Top right:		(259,259)

	So in general global structures must start in the range:
		(0,0) to (WORLD_SIZE*PORTION_SIZE+PORTION_SIZE-1, WORLD_SIZE*PORTION_SIZE+PORTION_SIZE-1)
		or
		(0,0) to (WORLD_SIZE*10+9, WORLD_SIZE*10+9)

		But push in by 1 on each side because the border. So:
		(1,1) to (WORLD_SIZE*10+8, WORLD_SIZE*10+8)

	Global structures are generated in 'make_world()' in 'worldgen.js'



Can make a mechanics video about world generation?
	- You can showcase it by turning off the grass.
	- I.e., prevent the grass from generating.
	- Can even get footage today.

Make the game require signup to play.
	Explain this is to track user engagement.

Idea for toolbar
	Can keep hold/drop buttons as they were before,
	but move them so they are like where the move and moveall buttons
	are.

	When you select the item, you get [1,2,3,4] to manually select
	the toolbar position.

Buckets should be craftable.

Maybe if it rains the level of water networks increase?

Bosses can be like BOTW, there are set locations when the map is generated.
If you enter their radius it begins the fight.
They could start off sleeping?

ADD MICHAEL SCOTT!

Also villagers/towns/villages. 

A shopkeep that spawns somewhere randomly would be great!

Mob ideas.

Make the sign in thing more friendly?
Also maybe make it so that mobile users can play? (Would be hard as fuck tbh.)

Could just like partition screen so game is played in the middle

(Should add that thing where when you place blocks it places one above... like maybe draw an arrow.)







Need to fix notification queue when mining ores! (Not super important/ low priority!)


Maybe make dungeons just like a fixed number of them. Like how the shop will be generated.

Shop should be contained within the inner two layers.

Make difficulty scale as you get further away from center.
	Should also mark center.

	Maybe expand toolbar?

	Run ad campaign for the website itself.


Crap ideas:

I kind of have an idea for improving rendering. You could just store objectNumbers per portion. You do lose some instance info for grass blocks. But when you render you could just call a static draw function which you get by using the objectNumber on an array like when saving. Could also have a tandem array that defines instance variables. (Just an idea, don't worry about it now.)
