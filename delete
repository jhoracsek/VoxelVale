Add to about, still needs to be optimized.


For simplicity, you can stop enemies when they're hit and collide with a block,
but at that point just make it so they can move through blocks for a few frames to
avoid getting stuck.



I kind of have an idea for improving rendering. You could just store objectNumbers per portion.
you do lose some instance info for grass blocks. But when you render you could just call a static
draw function which you get by using the objectNumber on an array like when saving.

Could also have a tandem array that defines instance variables. (Just an idea, don't worry about it now.)
